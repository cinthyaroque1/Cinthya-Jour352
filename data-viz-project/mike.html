<div id="text">
  Laura Lynn Davis called her representatives, her senators. She's written to celebrities and talk show hosts, thinking surely someone would help.<br></br> 
  Mike Davis, her husband of 27 years, was adopted by a soldier, a Vietnam veteran stationed in Ethiopia, who met him there as a boy and brought him to the U.S.<br></br> 
  He was deported to Ethiopia two decades ago, and now lives in a room with a mud floor and running water only once a month and even when the tap works, it isn't safe to drink.<br></br> 
  Davis, now 61, remembers his father telling him that everything would be OK because he was an American now. He pledged allegiance to the flag every morning and considered himself a happy military brat, moving around Army bases. <br></br>       
    
“I was living the American dream,” Davis said. <br></br>
He worked at a pizza shop through high school and when he graduated, he opened his own.<br></br>
In the 1990s, he was charged with possession of a firearm, marijuana and cocaine. He didn't go to prison; he was sentenced to 120 days in a boot camp program. He found out he'd never been naturalized when he reported to his probation officer.<br></br>
Nothing happened for years. He married Laura Lynn, they had children to raise, and he pushed it to the back of his mind  <br></br>
 
<div class="quote"> <span class = "green"> “My kids were sleeping, when they woke up, their dad was gone.” </span> <p class="quote-attribution"> - Mike Davis </p>  </div>
<br></br> 

Then one day in 2003, he closed his pizza shop and went to bed, someone banged on their door at 5 a.m. <br></br>
“My kids were sleeping,” he said, “When they woke up, their dad was gone.” <br></br>

<br></br>
He languished in a detention center for over a year, terrified, because he had the same perception of Ethiopia as many Americans: The State Department advises its citizens to not go there because of unpredictable violence, kidnappings, terrorism.<br></br>
Then officers took him to the airport and put him on a plane, he said. One officer felt sorry for him and gave him $20; Davis promised to pay him back when he returned to the U.S.<br></br>

He sold his wedding ring to pay rent, and that was the darkest moment. His adoptive father grew sicker, and Davis anguished over not being with him in the end.<br></br>
His wife sold their house and moved their family to be with him. But life was hard in Ethiopia: There were people with M16s on the street, they couldn't work or speak the language. Laura Lynn lost 30 pounds. She and their children went home to Georgia.<br></br>

Mike was their breadwinner, and they struggled without him. They lived in cars and motels, but never blamed him.<br></br>
Laura Lynn kept all his things neatly packed and awaiting his return: clothes, sports memorabilia, his favorite music — on cassette tapes, a reminder of how the world changed since he left. He gets sick a lot as he's getting older, she said, and can't access medications in Ethiopia.<br></br>
He has five grandchildren he's never met. His youngest son, Adam, 26 now, recently moved into his first apartment, and thought how nice it would be to have his father there to see it.<br></br>

</script>
<br></br>

Laura Lynn has more hope than she has in a long time, she said, because a group she never expected came to their aid: Koreans. They've offered advocacy and legal help. He's being represented by groups like Asian Americans Advancing Justice and Adoptees for Justice.<br></br>
“I pray we can make them see that he didn't ask to come here, he was adopted and brought here. He became a really good man,” she said. “He has a family who loves him and we're ready for him to come back home to us.”<br></br>

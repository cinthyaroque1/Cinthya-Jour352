      For most of her life, Joy Alessi was a proud patriot, who got teary-eyed when Garth Brooks sang about America. But patriotism is confusing for her now — as it is for many of the adoptees who've found themselves in this predicament. <br><br>
      Alessi and Buttons hadn't seen their friend and fellow adoptee, Leah Elmquist, since she became naturalized.<br><br>
      “Do you feel different? Do you feel like a citizen?” Alessi asked her, when they met for dinner at a Korean barbeque.<br><br>
      Elmquist had always considered herself “super-duper American.” She served in the Navy for 10 years; she was in a USAA commercial. That was all before she was actually made an American.<br><br>
      She told Alessi she doesn't feel any differently now.<br><br>
      “I felt like a citizen for the decade I was in the Navy. And I wasn't one,” she said.<br><br>

      <div class="quote"> <span class = "green"> "I didn't think about citizenship because I felt I was being more American than most Americans." </span> <p class="quote-attribution"> - Leah Elmquist </p></div>
      <br></br> 

Elmquist was adopted from South Korea as an infant in 1983, just six months too old to get citizenship by the 2000 legislation. <br></br>
She grew up in a white family in a Nebraska town with two stop lights. She can cite what her adoption decree declared her parents had done: they “do hereby bestow upon said minor child equal rights, privileges and immunities with children born in lawful wedlock.”<br></br>
That was not true, but she only learned that later.<br></br>
“That's why I joined the military. I felt so lucky to be an American, ironically. I wanted to thank this country for raising me,” she said. “I didn't think about citizenship because I felt I was being more American than most Americans."<br></br>


She excelled in the military, but wasn't eligible for certain security clearances. She's wanted to serve as a linguist, but couldn't. After leaving, she laid low, terrified of deportation. When Trump won election in 2016, she felt a fear more intense than the night before she deployed to Iraq.<br></br>
Alessi pulled up a photo of Elmquist in 2019, standing behind a podium marked with the seal of the U.S. House of Representatives. Elmquist was wearing her military uniform, and Alessi recalled that the room went quiet, all you could hear was the “click click click” of cameras.<br></br>
Elmquist remembered what she'd said: “I fought for my country, now it's time for my country to fight for me.” <br></br>
It didn't. <br></br>
That session, the bill didn't pass. <br></br>
Elmquist was rejected multiple times by immigration. Finally, she made it to an interview, and had to prove she could read and write English. Her interviewer was a veteran, like her, and said it seemed weird she was there. “Tell me about it,” she remembers responding. <br></br>

<br></br> 
She was naturalized in 2022, the day before her 40th birthday. She likes to look back at her picture on the front page of the local newspaper. <br></br>
“I can see how happy I was,” she says. “I almost cried.” <br></br>
“I can imagine,” Buttons responded. <br></br>
She smiled, and wiped away a tear, imagining that one day maybe she'd feel that too. <br></br>
